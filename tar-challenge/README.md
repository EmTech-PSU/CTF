# Tar Challenge
In this challenge you will have to find the flag in this .tar file. 
Tar is a Unix-based utility used to package files together. It creates an archive file(.tar) that holds multiple files. 
The catch with this challenge is your given the 100.tar file but you have to get to the 1.tar file embedded deeply in there to get the flag. You could untar the file (kind of like unzipping a file) from 100.tar to 99.tar to 98.tar...and so on, but that would take too long.
You'll need to use some sort of scripting method, whether it be python, bash, etc. to untar all the files and get the flag. Feel free to use Google on this one.
